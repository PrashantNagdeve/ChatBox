# ChatBox
I have created a simple chat application using Nodejs and MongoDB. In this application , user simply opens the link and get connected to other users. User can see upto 50 old messages in current chat.
To setup this app, see the package.json file which shows the dependency on different modules.
Entry point of this app is a file called server.js
